# Logistic-Regression-Assignment

<p> This Python program implements logistic regression using gradient descent optimization. It takes input from a text file containing feature data and labels, normalizes the features, and computes predictions, errors, and error squared using initial weights provided in the file. The program then updates the weights using gradient descent with a specified learning rate and iterates up to 2000 times. Results include weights, error analysis, and visualization of the decision boundary. </p>

## Key Features:

#### Input File: Reads feature data and labels from a text file.
#### Gradient Descent: Implements gradient descent to optimize weights for logistic regression.
#### Sigmoid Function: Utilizes the sigmoid function to compute predictions and derivatives.
#### Error Analysis: Calculates and tracks errors, error squared, and error deltas.
#### Normalization: Normalizes features to aid convergence during gradient descent.
#### Visualization: Generates plots to visualize the decision boundary and track the convergence of the cost function.


## Usage:

<p> Ensure Python and required libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed.
Prepare a text file containing feature data and labels.
Run the program, providing the input file path.
The program computes predictions, updates weights iteratively, and visualizes the decision boundary.
Review the output for weights, error analysis, and cost function convergence.</p>
